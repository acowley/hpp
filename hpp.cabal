synopsis:            A Haskell pre-processor

description: @hpp@ is a Haskell pre-processor that is also a
             C89/C90-compatible pre-processor (with the addition of a
             @--cpp@ flag). It is packaged as both a library and
             an executable.

             .

             To use as a Haskell preprocessor for resolving @#ifdef@
             conditionals and simple macro expansion while still
             allowing multi-line string literals, an invocation might
             look like,
             .
             @
             hpp -DDEBUG Foo.hs
             @
             .
             To use as a C preprocessor, an invocation might look
             like,
             .
             @
             hpp -DDEBUG --cpp foo.c
             @
             .

             To have GHC use @hpp@ as the C pre-processor, add this
             line to the top of a Haskell source file that makes use
             of the @CPP@ @LANGUAGE@ pragma.
             .
